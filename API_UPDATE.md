# API_UPDATE — What I'd build next (2 more hours)

If I had 2 more hours, I would:
1) Add lightweight personalization controls (tone/length/theme presets and a "scariness=0" safety knob).
2) Split the judge into two passes: a safety/age checker + a narrative-quality editor, then merge instructions.
3) Add minimal caching (hash prompt->response) to reduce cost and improve responsiveness.
4) Add a tiny web UI (Streamlit) for interactive story refinement and exporting.
